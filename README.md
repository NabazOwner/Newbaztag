## New firmware for the Violet Nabaztag WIFI bunny<br>Niels Moseley<br>

### Introduction
The Nabaztag was a WIFI conntected bunny made by Violet since 2005. As such, it was one of the first IOT devices on the market. Unfortunately, Violet went out of business and the internet services have stopped working.

The goal of this project is to replace the firmware of the Microchip PIC18F6627 I/PT microcontroller and give a second life to this cute little rabbit. My Nabaztag has a faulty BENQ PCMCIA WIFI card so I do not intend to support it, but substitute an ESP wifi module instead.
